As we are all using the same instance of IBM Event Automation, we will see the objects other students are creating. 
To avoid impact, you will use a prefix for each object you will create. 

	Account 	- Prefix
	Student01 	- ST01
	Student02	- ST02
	Student03 	- ST03
	Student04 	- ST02
	...
     
  
- During this lab, we will wirk with the Event Automation platform
